According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations:   alloc n \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to allocate n bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier x;  erase x \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to erase the block with the identifier x;  defragment \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; The memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of m bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the m-th.The first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of n successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.The second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.The last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.In the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.You are to write the implementation of the memory manager.

       " 'Most C/C++ programmers know about excellent opportunities that preprocessor #define directives give; but many know as well about the problems that can arise because of their careless use.In this problem we consider the following model of #define constructions (also called macros). Each macro has its name and value. The generic syntax for declaring a macro is the following:#define macro_name macro_valueAfter the macro has been declared, \"macro_name\" is replaced with \"macro_value\" each time it is met in the program (only the whole tokens can be replaced; i.e. \"macro_name\" is replaced only when it is surrounded by spaces or other non-alphabetic symbol). A \"macro_value\" within our model can only be an arithmetic expression consisting of variables, four arithmetic operations, brackets, and also the names of previously declared macros (in this case replacement is performed sequentially). The process of replacing macros with their values is called substitution.One of the main problems arising while using macros \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the situation when as a result of substitution we get an arithmetic expression with the changed order of calculation because of different priorities of the operations.Let\\'s consider the following example. Say, we declared such a #define construction:#define sum x + yand further in the program the expression \"2 * sum\" is calculated. After macro substitution is performed we get \"2 * x + y\", instead of intuitively expected \"2 * (x + y)\".Let\\'s call the situation \"suspicious\", if after the macro substitution the order of calculation changes, falling outside the bounds of some macro. Thus, your task is to find out by the given set of #define definitions and the given expression if this expression is suspicious or not.Let\\'s speak more formally. We should perform an ordinary macros substitution in the given expression. Moreover, we should perform a \"safe\" macros substitution in the expression, putting in brackets each macro value; after this, guided by arithmetic rules of brackets expansion, we can omit some of the brackets. If there exist a way to get an expression, absolutely coinciding with the expression that is the result of an ordinary substitution (character-by-character, but ignoring spaces), then this expression and the macros system are called correct, otherwise \\xe2\\x80\\x94 suspicious.Note that we consider the \"/\" operation as the usual mathematical division, not the integer division like in C/C++.

First, he stands at the end of the queue and the does the following: if importance of the task ai of the man in front of him is less than an, they swap their places (it looks like this: the man number n asks the one before him: \"Erm... Excuse me please but it\\'s very important for me... could you please let me move up the queue?\"), then he again poses the question to the man in front of him and so on. But in case when ai is greater than an, moving up the queue stops. However, the man number n can perform the operation no more than cn times.In our task let us suppose that by the moment when the man number n joins the queue, the process of swaps between n\\xe2\\x80\\x89-\\xe2\\x80\\x891 will have stopped. If the swap is possible it necessarily takes place.Your task is to help Vasya model the described process and find the order in which the people will stand in queue when all the swaps stops.',\n",

The cities are numbered from 1 to n. It is known that one can get from any city to any other one by the roads.n runners take part in the competition, one from each city. But Berland runners are talkative by nature and that's why the juries took measures to avoid large crowds of marathon participants. The jury decided that every runner should start the marathon from their hometown. Before the start every sportsman will get a piece of paper containing the name of the city where the sportsman's finishing line is. The finish is chosen randomly for every sportsman but it can't coincide with the sportsman's starting point. Several sportsmen are allowed to finish in one and the same city. All the sportsmen start simultaneously and everyone runs the shortest route from the starting point to the finishing one. All the sportsmen run at one speed which equals to 1.After the competition a follow-up table of the results will be composed where the sportsmen will be sorted according to the nondecrease of time they spent to cover the distance. The first g sportsmen in the table will get golden medals, the next s sportsmen will get silver medals and the rest will get bronze medals. Besides, if two or more sportsmen spend the same amount of time to cover the distance, they are sorted according to the number of the city where a sportsman started to run in the ascending order. That means no two sportsmen share one and the same place.According to the rules of the competition the number of gold medals g must satisfy the inequation g1\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x89\\xa4\\xe2\\x80\\x89g\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x89\\xa4\\xe2\\x80\\x89g2, where g1 and g2 are values formed historically.

Every summand is an expression \"a++\" or \"++a\" multiplied by some integer coefficient. If the coefficient is omitted, it is suggested being equal to 1.The calculation of such sum in C*++ goes the following way. First all the summands are calculated one after another, then they are summed by the usual arithmetic rules. If the summand contains \"a++\", then during the calculation first the value of the \"a\" variable is multiplied by the coefficient, then value of \"a\" is increased by 1.

The history has no records concerning how long the program had been working. By the time Petya returned, it had completed the calculations and had the result. However while Petya was drinking tea, a sly virus managed to destroy the input file so that Petya can\\'t figure out for which value of n the program was run. Help Petya, carry out the inverse function!Mostly, the program consists of a function in C++ with the following simplified syntax:  function ::= int f(int n) {operatorSequence} operatorSequence ::= operator\\xc2\\xa0|\\xc2\\xa0operator\\xc2\\xa0operatorSequence operator ::= return arithmExpr; | if (logicalExpr) return arithmExpr; logicalExpr ::= arithmExpr\\xe2\\x80\\x89>\\xe2\\x80\\x89arithmExpr | arithmExpr\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x89arithmExpr | arithmExpr == arithmExpr arithmExpr ::= sum sum ::= product | sum\\xe2\\x80\\x89+\\xe2\\x80\\x89product | sum\\xe2\\x80\\x89-\\xe2\\x80\\x89product product ::= multiplier | product\\xe2\\x80\\x89*\\xe2\\x80\\x89multiplier | product\\xe2\\x80\\x89/\\xe2\\x80\\x89multiplier multiplier ::= n | number | f(arithmExpr) number ::= 0|1|2|... |32767 The whitespaces in a operatorSequence are optional.Thus, we have a function, in which body there are two kinds of operators. There is the operator \"return arithmExpr;\" that returns the value of the expression as the value of the function, and there is the conditional operator \"if (logicalExpr) return arithmExpr;\" that returns the value of the arithmetical expression when and only when the logical expression is true. Guaranteed that no other constructions of C++ language \\xe2\\x80\\x94 cycles, assignment operators, nested conditional operators etc, and other variables except the n parameter are used in the function. All the constants are integers in the interval [0..32767].The operators are performed sequentially. After the function has returned a value other operators in the sequence are not performed. Arithmetical expressions are performed taking into consideration the standard priority of the operations. It means that first all the products that are part of the sum are calculated. During the calculation of the products the operations of multiplying and division are performed from the left to the right. Then the summands are summed, and the addition and the subtraction are also performed from the left to the right. Operations \">\" (more), \"<\" (less) and \"==\" (equals) also have standard meanings.Now you\\'ve got to pay close attention! The program is compiled with the help of 15-bit Berland C++ compiler invented by a Berland company BerSoft, that\\'s why arithmetical operations are performed in a non-standard way. Addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed modulo 32768 (if the result of subtraction is negative, then 32768 is added to it until the number belongs to the interval [0..32767]). Division \"/\" is a usual integer division where the remainder is omitted.Examples of arithmetical operations: Guaranteed that for all values of n from 0 to 32767 the given function is performed correctly. That means that:1. Division by 0 never occures.2. When performing a function for the value n\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x89N recursive calls of the function f may occur only for the parameter value of 0,\\xe2\\x80\\x891,\\xe2\\x80\\x89...,\\xe2\\x80\\x89N\\xe2\\x80\\x89-\\xe2\\x80\\x891. Consequently, the program never has an infinite recursion.3. As the result of the sequence of the operators, the function always returns a value.We have to mention that due to all the limitations the value returned by the function f is independent from either global variables or the order of performing the calculations of arithmetical expressions as part of the logical one, or from anything else except the value of n parameter. That\\'s why the f function can be regarded as a function in its mathematical sense, i.e. as a unique correspondence between any value of n from the interval [0..32767] and a value of f(n) from the same interval.Given the value of f(n), and you should find n. If the suitable n value is not unique, you should find the maximal one (from the interval [0..32767]).',\n",

The movement of a ship with a hyperdrive between two planets is performed along a straight line at the constant speed, the same for all the ships.

Every day the country's best shooters master their skills there and the many visitors compete in clay pigeon shooting to win decent prizes. And the head of the park has recently decided to make an online version of the shooting gallery. During the elaboration process it turned out that the program that imitates the process of shooting effectively, is needed. To formulate the requirements to the program, the shooting gallery was formally described. A 3D Cartesian system of coordinates was introduced, where the X axis ran across the gallery floor along the line, along which the shooters are located, the Y axis ran vertically along the gallery wall and the positive direction of the Z axis matched the shooting direction. Let's call the XOY plane a shooting plane and let's assume that all the bullets are out of the muzzles at the points of this area and fly parallel to the Z axis. Every clay pigeon can be represented as a rectangle whose sides are parallel to X and Y axes, and it has a positive z-coordinate. The distance between a clay pigeon and the shooting plane is always different for every target. The bullet hits the target if it goes through the inner area or border of the rectangle corresponding to it. When the bullet hits the target, the target falls down vertically into the crawl-space of the shooting gallery and cannot be shot at any more. The targets are tough enough, that's why a bullet can not pierce a target all the way through and if a bullet hits a target it can't fly on. In input the simulator program is given the arrangement of all the targets and also of all the shots in the order of their appearance. The program should determine which target was hit by which shot. If you haven't guessed it yet, you are the one who is to write such a program.\",\n",
       " \"Alas, finding one's true love is not easy. Masha has been unsuccessful in that yet. Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of one's Prince Charming through arithmancy. The phone number is divined like that. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example, let's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will be the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit is 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Masha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's number. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2\\xe2\\x80\\x89+\\xe2\\x80\\x899)\\xe2\\x80\\x89/\\xe2\\x80\\x892\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x895.5. Masha can round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she chooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way, i.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number. The result is (5\\xe2\\x80\\x89+\\xe2\\x80\\x893)\\xe2\\x80\\x89/\\xe2\\x80\\x892\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x894. In this case the answer is unique.

If needed, the digit can be rounded up or down.

In case there's no such place, the driver drives on searching for his perfect peaceful haven. Sometimes some cars leave the street and free some space for parking. Considering that there never are two moving cars on a street at a time write a program that can use the data on the drivers, entering the street hoping to park there and the drivers leaving it, to model the process and determine a parking lot space for each car.\",\n",

After an earthquake destroyed the temple, the Emperor understood that he somehow caused the wrath of gods to fall on his people. He ordered to bring the wise man. When the wise man appeared, the Emperor retold the dream to him and asked \"Oh the wisest among the wisest, tell me how could I have infuriated the Gods?\". \"My Lord,\" the wise man answered. \"As far as I can judge, the gods are angry because you were too haste to fulfill their order and didn\\'t listen to the end of the message\".Indeed, on the following night the Messenger appeared again.

However, carnivores should always be chased off them. For that a young player Vasya decided to make the shepherd run round the cows along one and the same closed path. It is very important that the cows stayed strictly inside the area limited by the path, as otherwise some cows will sooner or later be eaten. To be absolutely sure in the cows' safety, Vasya wants the path completion time to be minimum.The new game is launched for different devices, including mobile phones. That's why the developers decided to quit using the arithmetics with the floating decimal point and use only the arithmetics of integers. The cows and the shepherd in the game are represented as points on the plane with integer coordinates. The playing time is modeled by the turns. During every turn the shepherd can either stay where he stands or step in one of eight directions: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. As the coordinates should always remain integer, then the length of a horizontal and vertical step is equal to 1, and the length of a diagonal step is equal to . The cows do not move.

Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign.

       " \"Tyndex is again well ahead of the rivals! The reaction to the release of Zoozle Chrome browser was the release of a new browser Tyndex.Brome!The popularity of the new browser is growing daily. And the secret is not even the Tyndex.Bar installed (the Tyndex.Bar automatically fills the glass with the finest 1664 cognac after you buy Tyndex.Bottles and insert in into a USB port). It is highly popular due to the well-thought interaction with the user.Let us take, for example, the system of automatic address correction. Have you entered codehorses instead of codeforces? The gloomy Zoozle Chrome will sadly say that the address does not exist. Tyndex.Brome at the same time will automatically find the closest address and sent you there. That's brilliant!How does this splendid function work? That's simple! For each potential address a function of the F error is calculated by the following rules:  for every letter ci from the potential address c the closest position j of the letter ci in the address (s) entered by the user is found. The absolute difference |i\\xe2\\x80\\x89-\\xe2\\x80\\x89j| of these positions is added to F. So for every i (1\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x89\\xa4\\xe2\\x80\\x89i\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x89\\xa4\\xe2\\x80\\x89|c|) the position j is chosen such, that ci\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x89sj, and |i\\xe2\\x80\\x89-\\xe2\\x80\\x89j| is minimal possible.  if no such letter ci exists in the address entered by the user, then the length of the potential address |c| is added to F. After the values of the error function have been calculated for all the potential addresses the most suitable one is found. To understand the special features of the above described method better, it is recommended to realize the algorithm of calculating the F function for an address given by the user and some set of potential addresses.

She has already developed a search algorithm for the invisibility cloak in complex dynamic systems (Hogwarts is one of them).Hogwarts consists of n floors, numbered by integers from 1 to n. Some pairs of floors are connected by staircases. The staircases may change its position, moving exactly one end. Formally the situation is like this: if a staircase connects the floors a and b, then in one move it may modify its position so as to connect the floors a and c or b and c, where c is any floor different from a and b. Under no circumstances the staircase can connect a floor with itself. At the same time there can be multiple stairs between a pair of floors.Initially, Harry is on the floor with the number 1. He does not remember on what floor he has lost the cloak and wants to look for it on each of the floors. Therefore, his goal is to visit each of n floors at least once. Harry can visit the floors in any order and finish the searching at any floor.Nowadays the staircases move quite rarely. However, Ron and Hermione are willing to put a spell on any of them to help Harry find the cloak. To cause less suspicion, the three friends plan to move the staircases one by one, and no more than once for each staircase.

This rectangle is divided into n equal square sections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.Creating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into its neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the section.

Fuel can only flow through pipes in direction from node with smaller number to node with greater number. Any amount of fuel can enter through the first node and the last node is connected directly to the synchrophasotron.

Random decay is a process during which the edges of some path from the root to the random leaf of the tree are deleted. All the leaves are equiprobable.

       " 'Two good friends were trying to make a new programming language called Perse-script.The most important part of this language is strings. A string in Perse-script is put between characters \"So for example \"Hello\" is a string. But Hello is a variable name or a keyword, which are not considered in this problem.Perse-script is function-based. So there are no operators in this language. For example for summing two numbers you have to write sum(a,b) and not a+b.There are several functions for working on strings. These include:   concat(x,y) is a function which gets two strings x and y and puts y at the end of x and returns the result. For example concat(\"Hello\",\"World\") returns \"HelloWorld\".  reverse(x) gets a single string x and reverses it. For example reverse(\"Hello\") returns \"olleH\".  substr(x,a,b) gets a string x and two integers a and b (1\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x89\\xa4\\xe2\\x80\\x89a\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x89\\xa4\\xe2\\x80\\x89b\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x89\\xa4\\xe2\\x80\\x89n, where n is the length of x). And returns the substring of x between indexes a and b, inclusive. For example substr(\"Hello\",2,4) returns \"ell\".  substr(x,a,b,c) is another version of substr which works just like the last one but c is the step of adding. c is positive. For example substr(\"HelloWorld\",1,10,2) returns \"Hlool\". This substr means that you put the ath character , and then every cth character until you reach b.You\\'re going to manipulate the string part of Perse-script. Given a string expression, you should print its result.

Each day their number increases in several times and they don\\'t even realize how much their unhealthy obsession with trees harms the nature and the humankind. The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has dropped to 17 per cent and, as the best minds of the world think, that is not the end.In the middle of the 50-s of the previous century a group of soviet scientists succeed in foreseeing the situation with beavers and worked out a secret technology to clean territory. The technology bears a mysterious title \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\". Now the fate of the planet lies on the fragile shoulders of a small group of people who has dedicated their lives to science.The prototype is ready, you now need to urgently carry out its experiments in practice. You are given a tree, completely occupied by beavers. A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. The tree consists of n vertices, the i-th vertex contains ki beavers. \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" works by the following principle: being at some vertex u, it can go to the vertex v, if they are connected by an edge, and eat exactly one beaver located at the vertex v. It is impossible to move to the vertex v if there are no beavers left in v. \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" cannot just stand at some vertex and eat beavers in it. \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" must move without stops.Why does the \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" works like this? Because the developers have not provided place for the battery in it and eating beavers is necessary for converting their mass into pure energy.It is guaranteed that the beavers will be shocked by what is happening, which is why they will not be able to move from a vertex of the tree to another one. As for the \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\", it can move along each edge in both directions while conditions described above are fulfilled.The root of the tree is located at the vertex s. This means that the \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" begins its mission at the vertex s and it must return there at the end of experiment, because no one is going to take it down from a high place. Determine the maximum number of beavers \"Beavermuncher-0xFF\" can eat and return to the starting vertex.',\n",

But who would have thought that even in a regular array of numbers Valera manages to see something beautiful and magical.Valera absolutely accidentally got a piece of ancient parchment on which an array of numbers was written. He immediately thought that the numbers in this array were not random. As a result of extensive research Valera worked out a wonderful property that a magical array should have: an array is defined as magic if its minimum and maximum coincide.He decided to share this outstanding discovery with you, but he asks you for help in return. Despite the tremendous intelligence and wit, Valera counts very badly and so you will have to complete his work. All you have to do is count the number of magical subarrays of the original array of numbers, written on the parchment. Subarray is defined as non-empty sequence of consecutive elements.',\n",

Although our hero Valera was not present at this spectacular event himself and only watched it on TV, it excited him so much that he decided to enroll in a biathlon section.Of course, biathlon as any sport, proved very difficult in practice. It takes much time and effort. Workouts, workouts, and workouts, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\'s what awaited Valera on his way to great achievements in biathlon.As for the workouts, you all probably know that every professional biathlete should ski fast and shoot precisely at the shooting range. Only in this case you can hope to be successful, because running and shooting are the two main components of biathlon. Valera has been diligent in his ski trainings, which is why he runs really fast, however, his shooting accuracy is nothing to write home about.On a biathlon base where Valera is preparing for the competition, there is a huge rifle range with n targets. Each target have shape of a circle, and the center of each circle is located on the Ox axis. At the last training session Valera made the total of m shots. To make monitoring of his own results easier for him, one rather well-known programmer (of course it is you) was commissioned to write a program that would reveal how many and which targets Valera hit. More specifically, for each target the program must print the number of the first successful shot (in the target), or \"-1\" if this was not hit. The target is considered hit if the shot is inside the circle or on its boundary. Valera is counting on you and perhaps, thanks to you he will one day win international competitions.',\n",

We will assume that an examination takes much more time than making tests and other extra procedures, and therefore we will assume that once an animal leaves the room, it immediately gets to the end of the queue to the doctor. Of course, if the animal has visited the doctor as many times as necessary, then it doesn't have to stand at the end of the queue and it immediately goes home.

Besides, the actions should be performed in the given order.For each action several separate windows are singled out: k1 separate windows for the first action (the first type windows), k2 windows for the second one (the second type windows), and k3 for the third one (the third type windows). The service time for one person in any of the first type window equals to t1. Similarly, it takes t2 time to serve a person in any of the second type windows. And it takes t3 to serve one person in any of the third type windows. Thus, the service time depends only on the window type and is independent from the person who is applying for visa.At some moment n people come to the embassy, the i-th person comes at the moment of time ci. The person is registered under some number. After that he sits in the hall and waits for his number to be shown on a special board. Besides the person's number the board shows the number of the window where one should go and the person goes there immediately. Let's consider that the time needed to approach the window is negligible. The table can show information for no more than one person at a time.

The horrifying thing was that Petya couldn\\'t search for elements in this tree. Petya tried many times to choose key and look for it in the tree, and each time he arrived at a wrong place. Petya has been racking his brains for long, choosing keys many times, but the result was no better. But the moment before Petya would start to despair, he had an epiphany: every time he was looking for keys, the tree didn\\'t have the key, and occured exactly one mistake. \"That\\'s not a problem!\", thought Petya. \"Why not count the expectation value of an element, which is found when I search for the key\". The moment he was about to do just that, however, Petya suddenly woke up.Thus, you are given a binary search tree, that is a tree containing some number written in the node. This number is called the node key. The number of children of every node of the tree is equal either to 0 or to 2. The nodes that have 0 children are called leaves and the nodes that have 2 children, are called inner. An inner node has the left child, that is the child whose key is less than the current node\\'s key, and the right child, whose key is more than the current node\\'s key. Also, a key of any node is strictly larger than all the keys of the left subtree of the node and strictly smaller than all the keys of the right subtree of the node.Also you are given a set of search keys, all of which are distinct and differ from the node keys contained in the tree. For each key from the set its search in the tree is realised. The search is arranged like this: initially we are located in the tree root, if the key of the current node is larger that our search key, then we move to the left child of the node, otherwise we go to the right child of the node and the process is repeated. As it is guaranteed that the search key is not contained in the tree, the search will always finish in some leaf. The key lying in the leaf is declared the search result.It is known for sure that during the search we make a mistake in comparing exactly once, that is we go the wrong way, but we won\\'t make any mistakes later. All possible mistakes are equiprobable, that is we should consider all such searches where exactly one mistake occurs. Your task is to find the expectation (the average value) of the search result for every search key, considering that exactly one mistake occurs in the search.

       " 'Programmer Vasya is studying a new programming language &K*. The &K* language resembles the languages of the C family in its syntax. However, it is more powerful, which is why the rules of the actual C-like languages are unapplicable to it. To fully understand the statement, please read the language\\'s description below carefully and follow it and not the similar rules in real programming languages.There is a very powerful system of pointers on &K* \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you can add an asterisk to the right of the existing type X \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that will result in new type X\\xe2\\x80\\x89*\\xe2\\x80\\x89. That is called pointer-definition operation. Also, there is the operation that does the opposite \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to any type of X, which is a pointer, you can add an ampersand \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that will result in a type &X, to which refers X. That is called a dereference operation.The &K* language has only two basic data types \\xe2\\x80\\x94 void and errtype. Also, the language has operators typedef and typeof. The operator \"typedef A B\" defines a new data type B, which is equivalent to A. A can have asterisks and ampersands, and B cannot have them. For example, the operator typedef void** ptptvoid will create a new type ptptvoid, that can be used as void**. The operator \"typeof A\" returns type of A, brought to void, that is, returns the type void**...*, equivalent to it with the necessary number of asterisks (the number can possibly be zero). That is, having defined the ptptvoid type, as shown above, the typeof ptptvoid operator will return void**.An attempt of dereferencing of the void type will lead to an error: to a special data type errtype. For errtype the following equation holds true: errtype*\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x89&errtype\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x89errtype. An attempt to use the data type that hasn\\'t been defined before that will also lead to the errtype.Using typedef, we can define one type several times. Of all the definitions only the last one is valid. However, all the types that have been defined earlier using this type do not change.Let us also note that the dereference operation has the lower priority that the pointer operation, in other words &T\\xe2\\x80\\x89*\\xe2\\x80\\x89 is always equal to T.Note, that the operators are executed consecutively one by one. If we have two operators \"typedef &void a\" and \"typedef a* b\", then at first a becomes errtype, and after that b becomes errtype* = errtype, but not &void* = void (see sample 2).Vasya does not yet fully understand this powerful technology, that\\'s why he asked you to help him. Write a program that analyzes these operators. ',\n",

The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z \\xe2\\x80\\x94 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \\xe2\\x80\\x94 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.',\n",

However, he can only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers of the keys does not exceed x. The keys are considered as squares with a side equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys.Vasya is a very lazy boy, that\\'s why he tries to type with one hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible that some symbol can\\'t be typed with one hand only, because the distance between it and the closest \"Shift\" key is strictly larger than x.

       " 'Programmer Vasya is studying a new programming language &K*. The &K* language resembles the languages of the C family in its syntax. However, it is more powerful, which is why the rules of the actual C-like languages are unapplicable to it. To fully understand the statement, please read the language\\'s description below carefully and follow it and not the similar rules in real programming languages.There is a very powerful system of pointers on &K* \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you can add an asterisk to the right of the existing type X \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that will result in new type X\\xe2\\x80\\x89*\\xe2\\x80\\x89. That is called pointer-definition operation. Also, there is the operation that does the opposite \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to any type of X, which is a pointer, you can add an ampersand \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that will result in a type &X, to which refers X. That is called a dereference operation.The &K* language has only two basic data types \\xe2\\x80\\x94 void and errtype. Also, the language has operators typedef and typeof. The operator \"typedef A B\" defines a new data type B, which is equivalent to A. A can have asterisks and ampersands, and B cannot have them. For example, the operator typedef void** ptptvoid will create a new type ptptvoid, that can be used as void**. The operator \"typeof A\" returns type of A, brought to void, that is, returns the type void**...*, equivalent to it with the necessary number of asterisks (the number can possibly be zero). That is, having defined the ptptvoid type, as shown above, the typeof ptptvoid operator will return void**.An attempt of dereferencing of the void type will lead to an error: to a special data type errtype. For errtype the following equation holds true: errtype*\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x89&errtype\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x89errtype. An attempt to use the data type that hasn\\'t been defined before that will also lead to the errtype.Using typedef, we can define one type several times. Of all the definitions only the last one is valid. However, all the types that have been defined earlier using this type do not change.Let us also note that the dereference operation has the lower priority that the pointer operation, in other words &T\\xe2\\x80\\x89*\\xe2\\x80\\x89 is always equal to T.Note, that the operators are executed consecutively one by one. If we have two operators \"typedef &void a\" and \"typedef a* b\", then at first a becomes errtype, and after that b becomes errtype* = errtype, but not &void* = void (see sample 2).Vasya does not yet fully understand this powerful technology, that\\'s why he asked you to help him. Write a program that analyzes these operators. ',\n",

       " \"Vasya writes his own library for building graphical user interface. Vasya called his creation VTK (VasyaToolKit). One of the interesting aspects of this library is that widgets are packed in each other. A widget is some element of graphical interface. Each widget has width and height, and occupies some rectangle on the screen. Any widget in Vasya's library is of type Widget. For simplicity we will identify the widget and its type. Types HBox and VBox are derivatives of type Widget, so they also are types Widget. Widgets HBox and VBox are special. They can store other widgets. Both those widgets can use the pack() method to pack directly in itself some other widget. Widgets of types HBox and VBox can store several other widgets, even several equal widgets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they will simply appear several times. As a result of using the method pack() only the link to the packed widget is saved, that is when the packed widget is changed, its image in the widget, into which it is packed, will also change. We shall assume that the widget a is packed in the widget b if there exists a chain of widgets a\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x89c1,\\xe2\\x80\\x89c2,\\xe2\\x80\\x89...,\\xe2\\x80\\x89ck\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x89b, k\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x89\\xa5\\xe2\\x80\\x892, for which ci is packed directly to ci\\xe2\\x80\\x89+\\xe2\\x80\\x891 for any 1\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x89\\xa4\\xe2\\x80\\x89i\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x89k. In Vasya's library the situation when the widget a is packed in the widget a (that is, in itself) is not allowed. If you try to pack the widgets into each other in this manner immediately results in an error.Also, the widgets HBox and VBox have parameters border and spacing, which are determined by the methods set_border() and set_spacing() respectively. By default both of these options equal 0.    The picture above shows how the widgets are packed into HBox and VBox. At that HBox and VBox automatically change their size depending on the size of packed widgets. As for HBox and VBox, they only differ in that in HBox the widgets are packed horizontally and in VBox \\xe2\\x80\\x94 vertically. The parameter spacing sets the distance between adjacent widgets, and border \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a frame around all packed widgets of the desired width. Packed widgets are placed exactly in the order in which the pack() method was called for them. If within HBox or VBox there are no packed widgets, their sizes are equal to 0\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc3\\x97\\xe2\\x80\\x890, regardless of the options border and spacing. The construction of all the widgets is performed using a scripting language VasyaScript. The description of the language can be found in the input data. For the final verification of the code Vasya asks you to write a program that calculates the sizes of all the widgets on the source code in the language of VasyaScript. \",\n",

The book read \"Azembler. Principally New Approach\".Having carefully thumbed through the book, Igor K. realised that, as it turns out, you can multiply the numbers dozens of times faster. \"Search Ultimate will be faster than it has ever been!\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the fellow shouted happily and set to work.Let us now clarify what Igor\\'s idea was. The thing is that the code that was generated by a compiler was far from perfect. Standard multiplying does work slower than with the trick the book mentioned.The Azembler language operates with 26 registers (eax, ebx, ..., ezx) and two commands:   [x] \\xe2\\x80\\x94 returns the value located in the address x. For example, [eax] returns the value that was located in the address, equal to the value in the register eax.  lea x, y \\xe2\\x80\\x94 assigns to the register x, indicated as the first operand, the second operand\\'s address. Thus, for example, the \"lea ebx, [eax]\" command will write in the ebx register the content of the eax register: first the [eax] operation will be fulfilled, the result of it will be some value that lies in the address written in eax. But we do not need the value \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the next operation will be lea, that will take the [eax] address, i.e., the value in the eax register, and will write it in ebx. On the first thought the second operation seems meaningless, but as it turns out, it is acceptable to write the operation as lea ecx, [eax + ebx],lea ecx, [k*eax]or evenlea ecx, [ebx + k*eax],where k = 1, 2, 4 or 8.As a result, the register ecx will be equal to the numbers eax + ebx, k*eax and ebx + k*eax correspondingly. However, such operation is fulfilled many times, dozens of times faster that the usual multiplying of numbers. And using several such operations, one can very quickly multiply some number by some other one. Of course, instead of eax, ebx and ecx you are allowed to use any registers.For example, let the eax register contain some number that we should multiply by 41. It takes us 2 lines:lea ebx, [eax + 4*eax] // now ebx = 5*eaxlea eax, [eax + 8*ebx] // now eax = eax + 8*ebx = 41*eaxIgor K. got interested in the following question: what is the minimum number of lea operations needed to multiply by the given number n and how to do it?

The dictator is a very efficient manager, yet he can't personally give orders to each and every citizen. That's why he decided to pick some set of leaders he would control. Those leaders will directly order the citizens. However, leadership efficiency turned out to vary from person to person (i.e. while person A makes an efficient leader, person B may not be that good at it). That's why the dictator asked world-famous berland scientists for help. The scientists suggested an innovatory technology \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to make the leaders work in pairs.A relationship graph is some undirected graph whose vertices correspond to people. A simple path is a path with no repeated vertices.

       " \"This is the modification of the problem used during the official round. Unfortunately, author's solution of the original problem appeared wrong, so the problem was changed specially for the archive.Once upon a time in a far away kingdom lived the King. The King had a beautiful daughter, Victoria. They lived happily, but not happily ever after: one day a vicious dragon attacked the kingdom and stole Victoria. The King was full of grief, yet he gathered his noble knights and promised half of his kingdom and Victoria's hand in marriage to the one who will save the girl from the infernal beast.Having travelled for some time, the knights found the dragon's lair and all of them rushed there to save Victoria. Each knight spat on the dragon once and, as the dragon had quite a fragile and frail heart, his heart broke and poor beast died. As for the noble knights, they got Victoria right to the King and started brawling as each one wanted the girl's hand in marriage.The problem was that all the noble knights were equally noble and equally handsome, and Victoria didn't want to marry any of them anyway. Then the King (and he was a very wise man and didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings) decided to find out who will get his daughter randomly, i.e. tossing a coin. However, there turned out to be n noble knights and the coin only has two sides. The good thing is that when a coin is tossed, the coin falls on each side with equal probability. The King got interested how to pick one noble knight using this coin so that all knights had equal probability of being chosen (the probability in that case should always be equal to 1\\xe2\\x80\\x89/\\xe2\\x80\\x89n). First the King wants to know the expected number of times he will need to toss a coin to determine the winner. Besides, while tossing the coin, the King should follow the optimal tossing strategy (i.e. the strategy that minimizes the expected number of tosses). Help the King in this challenging task.\",\n",

Thus, the possible Armageddon can come earlier than was initially planned by gods. Much earlier. So much earlier, in fact, that Ku Sean Sun won't even have time to ski all he wants or relax under the air conditioner.The wise prior could never let that last thing happen and he asked one very old and very wise witch PikiWedia to help him.

       " \"In Disgaea as in most role-playing games, characters have skills that determine the character's ability to use certain weapons or spells. If the character does not have the necessary skill, he cannot use it. The skill level is represented as an integer that increases when you use this skill. Different character classes are characterized by different skills. Unfortunately, the skills that are uncommon for the given character's class are quite difficult to obtain. To avoid this limitation, there is the so-called transmigration. Transmigration is reincarnation of the character in a new creature. His soul shifts to a new body and retains part of his experience from the previous life. As a result of transmigration the new character gets all the skills of the old character and the skill levels are reduced according to the k coefficient (if the skill level was equal to x, then after transmigration it becomes equal to [kx], where [y] is the integral part of y). If some skill's levels are strictly less than 100, these skills are forgotten (the character does not have them any more). After that the new character also gains the skills that are specific for his class, but are new to him. The levels of those additional skills are set to 0. Thus, one can create a character with skills specific for completely different character classes via transmigrations. For example, creating a mage archer or a thief warrior is possible. You are suggested to solve the following problem: what skills will the character have after transmigration and what will the levels of those skills be?\",\n",

Each of them makes a positive or negative decision in accordance with their loyalty. If strictly more than half of the senators take a positive decision, the player's proposal is approved.

Each Geo Symbol is located on one Geo Panel, and each Geo Panel may contain no more than one Geo Symbol. Geo Symbols can be eliminated. To understand better what happens when a Geo Symbol is eliminated, let us introduce some queue to which we will put the recently eliminated Geo Symbols. Let's put at the head of the queue a Geo Symbol that was eliminated just now. Next, we will repeat the following operation: Extract the Geo Symbol from the queue. Look at the color of the panel containing the given Geo Symbol. If it differs from transparent and differs from the color of the Geo Symbol, then all Geo Panels of this color are repainted in the color of the given Geo Symbol (transparent Geo Symbols repaint the Geo Panels transparent).

The photos are not necessarily placed horizontally or vertically, they could also be rotated before being pinned to the wall.The score of one dart throw is simply the number of photos the dart went through.Fatma has made a throw but her score was not recorded. She only remembers that she did make it into at least one photo.Assuming that the probability distribution of the throw is equal across the whole wall, what would be the expectation of Fatma's score?\",\n",

       " 'The German University in Cairo (GUC) dorm houses are numbered from 1 to n. Underground water pipes connect these houses together. Each pipe has certain direction (water can flow only in this direction and not vice versa), and diameter (which characterizes the maximal amount of water it can handle).For each house, there is at most one pipe going into it and at most one pipe going out of it. With the new semester starting, GUC student and dorm resident, Lulu, wants to install tanks and taps at the dorms. For every house with an outgoing water pipe and without an incoming water pipe, Lulu should install a water tank at that house. For every house with an incoming water pipe and without an outgoing water pipe, Lulu should install a water tap at that house. Each tank house will convey water to all houses that have a sequence of pipes from the tank to it. Accordingly, each tap house will receive water originating from some tank house.In order to avoid pipes from bursting one week later (like what happened last semester), Lulu also has to consider the diameter of the pipes. The amount of water each tank conveys should not exceed the diameter of the pipes connecting a tank to its corresponding tap.

Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala.  Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra.  Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites.  Thus, each word in the Petya\\'s language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya\\'s language.  It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words \"lios\", \"liala\", \"etr\" and so on belong to the Petya\\'s language.  There aren\\'t any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications.  A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement. Statement is any sequence of the Petya\\'s language, that satisfy both conditions: Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs.  All words in the statement should have the same gender.After Petya\\'s friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya\\'s language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program. As Vasya was in the country and Petya didn\\'t feel like waiting, he asked you to help him with this problem. Your task is to define by a given sequence of words, whether it is true that the given text represents exactly one sentence in Petya\\'s language.',\n",

Besides, the construction resulting from the gluing process should also represent a spider, that is, it should have the given features. After Petya glues all spiders together, he measures the length of the resulting toy. The distance between a pair of beads is identified as the total length of the threads that connect these two beads. The length of the resulting construction is the largest distance between all pairs of beads. Petya wants to make the spider whose length is as much as possible.

It goes like that: Initially the time for each turn is t. While the time left to a player is more than 0, a player takes a card from the top of the deck and starts explaining the word it has to his teammate. The time needed for the j-th player of the i-th team to explain the word from the card k to his teammate (the q-th player of the i-th team) equals max(1,\\xe2\\x80\\x89ck\\xe2\\x80\\x89-\\xe2\\x80\\x89(aij\\xe2\\x80\\x89+\\xe2\\x80\\x89biq)\\xe2\\x80\\x89-\\xe2\\x80\\x89dik) (if j\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x891,\\xe2\\x80\\x89 then q\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x892,\\xe2\\x80\\x89 else q\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x891).

If a team manages to guess the word before the end of the turn, then the time given above is substracted from the duration of the turn, the card containing the guessed word leaves the game, the team wins one point and the game continues. If the team doesn't manage to guess the word, then the card is put at the bottom of the deck, dik increases on the amount of time of the turn, spent on explaining the word.

Besides, Vasya cannot understand why all tickets are only divided into lucky and unlucky ones. He thinks that all tickets are lucky but in different degrees. Having given the matter some thought, Vasya worked out the definition of a ticket's degree of luckiness. Let a ticket consist of 2n digits. Let's regard each digit as written as is shown on the picture:  You have seen such digits on electronic clocks: seven segments are used to show digits. Each segment can either be colored or not.

The interpreter finds the furthest edge of the current color block in the direction of the DP. From all pixels that form this edge, the interpreter selects the furthest one in the direction of CP. After this, BP attempts to move from this pixel into the next one in the direction of DP. If the next pixel belongs to a colored block, this block becomes the current one, and two other parts of IP stay the same. It the next pixel is black or outside of the program, BP stays the same but two other parts of IP change. If CP was pointing to the left, now it points to the right, and DP stays the same. If CP was pointing to the right, now it points to the left, and DP is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.This way BP will never point to a black block (it is guaranteed that top-left pixel of the program will not be black).You are given a Piet program. You have to figure out which block of the program will be current after n steps.',\n",

If in each quatrain all lines pairwise rhyme, then the rhyme scheme of the poem is aaaa. Let us note that it doesn\\'t matter whether lines from different quatrains rhyme with each other or not. In other words, it is possible that different quatrains aren\\'t connected by a rhyme.Vera got a long poem as a home task. The girl has to analyse it and find the poem rhyme scheme.

At some point it turned out that if we sum the resulting numbers, then the number of zeroes with which the sum will end would be maximum among the possible variants of digit permutations in those numbers.Given number n, can you find the two digit permutations that have this property?\",\n",
       " \"One day Natalia was walking in the woods when she met a little mushroom gnome. The gnome told her the following story:Everybody knows that the mushroom gnomes' power lies in the magic mushrooms that grow in the native woods of the gnomes. There are n trees and m magic mushrooms in the woods: the i-th tree grows at a point on a straight line with coordinates ai and has the height of hi, the j-th mushroom grows at the point with coordinates bj and has magical powers zj.But one day wild mushroommunchers, the sworn enemies of mushroom gnomes unleashed a terrible storm on their home forest. As a result, some of the trees began to fall and crush the magic mushrooms. The supreme oracle of mushroom gnomes calculated in advance the probability for each tree that it will fall to the left, to the right or will stand on. If the tree with the coordinate x and height h falls to the left, then all the mushrooms that belong to the right-open interval [x\\xe2\\x80\\x89-\\xe2\\x80\\x89h,\\xe2\\x80\\x89x), are destroyed. If a tree falls to the right, then the mushrooms that belong to the left-open interval (x,\\xe2\\x80\\x89x\\xe2\\x80\\x89+\\xe2\\x80\\x89h] are destroyed. Only those mushrooms that are not hit by a single tree survive.Knowing that all the trees fall independently of each other (i.e., all the events are mutually independent, and besides, the trees do not interfere with other trees falling in an arbitrary direction), the supreme oracle was also able to quickly calculate what would be the expectation of the total power of the mushrooms which survived after the storm. His calculations ultimately saved the mushroom gnomes from imminent death.Natalia, as a good Olympiad programmer, got interested in this story, and she decided to come up with a way to quickly calculate the expectation of the sum of the surviving mushrooms' power.\",\n",

So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far Away and very soon even the rounding didn\\'t help to quickly determine even the order of the numbers involved in operations. Besides, rounding a number to an integer wasn\\'t very convenient as a bank needed to operate with all numbers with accuracy of up to 0.01, and not up to an integer.The King issued yet another order: to introduce financial format to represent numbers denoting amounts of money. The formal rules of storing a number in the financial format are as follows:   A number contains the integer part and the fractional part. The two parts are separated with a character \".\" (decimal point).  To make digits in the integer part of a number easier to read, they are split into groups of three digits, starting from the least significant ones. The groups are separated with the character \",\" (comma). For example, if the integer part of a number equals 12345678, then it will be stored in the financial format as 12,345,678  In the financial format a number\\'s fractional part should contain exactly two digits. So, if the initial number (the number that is converted into the financial format) contains less than two digits in the fractional part (or contains no digits at all), it is complemented with zeros until its length equals 2. If the fractional part contains more than two digits, the extra digits are simply discarded (they are not rounded: see sample tests).  When a number is stored in the financial format, the minus sign is not written. Instead, if the initial number had the minus sign, the result is written in round brackets.  Please keep in mind that the bank of Far Far Away operates using an exotic foreign currency \\xe2\\x80\\x94 snakes ($), that\\'s why right before the number in the financial format we should put the sign \"$\".

He was very proud of his men and he liked to invite the King to come and watch drill exercises which demonstrated the fighting techniques and tactics of the squad he was in charge of. But time went by and one day Sir Lancelot had a major argument with the Fairy Godmother (there were rumors that the argument occurred after the general spoke badly of the Godmother\\'s flying techniques. That seemed to hurt the Fairy Godmother very deeply). As the result of the argument, the Godmother put a rather strange curse upon the general. It sounded all complicated and quite harmless: \"If the squared distance between some two soldiers equals to 5, then those soldiers will conflict with each other!\"The drill exercises are held on a rectangular n\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc3\\x97\\xe2\\x80\\x89m field, split into nm square 1\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc3\\x97\\xe2\\x80\\x891 segments for each soldier.

Unless, of course, the general wants the soldiers to fight with each other or even worse...

       " 'Once Petya read a problem about a bracket sequence. He gave it much thought but didn\\'t find a solution. Today you will face it.You are given string s. It represents a correct bracket sequence. A correct bracket sequence is the sequence of opening (\"(\") and closing (\")\") brackets, such that it is possible to obtain a correct mathematical expression from it, inserting numbers and operators between the brackets. For example, such sequences as \"(())()\" and \"()\" are correct bracket sequences and such sequences as \")()\" and \"(()\" are not.In a correct bracket sequence each bracket corresponds to the matching bracket (an opening bracket corresponds to the matching closing bracket and vice versa). For example, in a bracket sequence shown of the figure below, the third bracket corresponds to the matching sixth one and the fifth bracket corresponds to the fourth one.   You are allowed to color some brackets in the bracket sequence so as all three conditions are fulfilled:   Each bracket is either not colored any color, or is colored red, or is colored blue.  For any pair of matching brackets exactly one of them is colored. In other words, for any bracket the following is true: either it or the matching bracket that corresponds to it is colored.  No two neighboring colored brackets have the same color. Find the number of different ways to color the bracket sequence. The ways should meet the above-given conditions. Two ways of coloring are considered different if they differ in the color of at least one bracket.

That is, the protected part is the intersection of the generators' active ranges.The number of generators available to the colonists is not limited, but the system of field generation consumes a lot of energy.

Sentences of the N-ish language can be represented as strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters without spaces or punctuation marks.Sergey totally forgot about the task until half an hour before the next lesson and hastily scribbled something down. But then he recollected that in the last lesson he learned the grammar of N-ish. The spelling rules state that N-ish contains some \"forbidden\" pairs of letters: such letters can never occur in a sentence next to each other. Also, the order of the letters doesn\\'t matter (for example, if the pair of letters \"ab\" is forbidden, then any occurrences of substrings \"ab\" and \"ba\" are also forbidden). Also, each pair has different letters and each letter occurs in no more than one forbidden pair.Now Sergey wants to correct his sentence so that it doesn\\'t contain any \"forbidden\" pairs of letters that stand next to each other. However, he is running out of time, so he decided to simply cross out some letters from the sentence. What smallest number of letters will he have to cross out? When a letter is crossed out, it is \"removed\" so that the letters to its left and right (if they existed), become neighboring. For example, if we cross out the first letter from the string \"aba\", we get the string \"ba\", and if we cross out the second letter, we get \"aa\".',\n",

After all, your twin is sleeping and he won\\'t know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you\\'ve decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins. On this basis, determine what minimum number of coins you need to take to divide them in the described manner.',\n",
       " \"Each of you probably has your personal experience of riding public transportation and buying tickets. After a person buys a ticket (which traditionally has an even number of digits), he usually checks whether the ticket is lucky. Let us remind you that a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches the sum of digits in its second half.But of course, not every ticket can be lucky. Far from it! Moreover, sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say right away that the ticket is not lucky. So, let's consider the following unluckiness criterion that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket. We'll say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so that each digit from the first half is strictly less than the corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the first half is strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second one. Each digit should be used exactly once in the comparisons. In other words, there is such bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and the second half of the ticket, that either each digit of the first half turns out strictly less than the corresponding digit of the second half or each digit of the first half turns out strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second half.For example, ticket 2421 meets the following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky (the sought correspondence is 2\\xe2\\x80\\x89>\\xe2\\x80\\x891 and 4\\xe2\\x80\\x89>\\xe2\\x80\\x892), ticket 0135 also meets the criterion (the sought correspondence is 0\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x893 and 1\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x895), and ticket 3754 does not meet the criterion.

So you want to make it as short as possible without changing the meaning.The only way to shorten a spell that you know is the removal of some spaces and line breaks. We know that when it comes to texts of spells, the spaces carry meaning only in the amplifying lines, so we should remove all spaces in other lines. Newlines also do not matter, unless any of the two separated lines is amplifying. Thus, if two consecutive lines are not amplifying, they need to be joined into one (i.e. we should concatenate the second line to the first one).

At the time of arrival at the destination station the trolleybus does not necessarily have zero speed. When a trolley is leaving the depot, its speed is considered equal to zero. From the point of view of physics, the trolleybuses can be considered as material points, and also we should ignore the impact on the speed of a trolley bus by everything, except for the acceleration and deceleration provided by the engine.\",\n",

To make the lives of citizens of Berland more varied, it was decided to change the calendar. As more and more people are complaining that \"the years fly by...\", it was decided that starting from the next year the number of days per year will begin to grow. So the coming year will have exactly a days, the next after coming year will have a\\xe2\\x80\\x89+\\xe2\\x80\\x891 days, the next one will have a\\xe2\\x80\\x89+\\xe2\\x80\\x892 days and so on.

An MP Palevny made the following proposal.   The calendar for each month is comfortable to be printed on a square sheet of paper. We are proposed to make the number of days in each month be the square of some integer. The number of days per month should be the same for each month of any year, but may be different for different years.  The number of days in each year must be divisible by the number of days per month in this year. This rule ensures that the number of months in each year is an integer.  The number of days per month for each year must be chosen so as to save the maximum amount of paper to print the calendars. In other words, the number of days per month should be as much as possible. These rules provide an unambiguous method for choosing the number of days in each month for any given year length. For example, according to Palevny\\'s proposition, a year that consists of 108 days will have three months, 36 days each. The year that consists of 99 days will have 11 months, 9 days each, and a year of 365 days will have 365 months, one day each.The proposal provoked heated discussion in the community, the famous mathematician Perelmanov quickly calculated that if the proposal is supported, then in a period of n years, beginning with the year that has a days, the country will spend p sheets of paper to print a set of calendars for these years. Perelmanov\\'s calculations take into account the fact that the set will contain one calendar for each year and each month will be printed on a separate sheet.Repeat Perelmanov\\'s achievement and print the required number p.

       " 'This problem is about imaginary languages BHTML and BCSS, which slightly resemble HTML and CSS. Read the problem statement carefully as the resemblance is rather slight and the problem uses very simplified analogs.You are given a BHTML document that resembles HTML but is much simpler. It is recorded as a sequence of opening and closing tags. A tag that looks like \"<tagname>\" is called an opening tag and a tag that looks like \"</tagname>\" is called a closing tag. Besides, there are self-closing tags that are written as \"<tagname/>\" and in this problem they are fully equivalent to \"<tagname></tagname>\". All tagnames in this problem are strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length from 1 to 10 characters. Tagnames of different tags may coincide.The document tags form a correct bracket sequence, that is, we can obtain an empty sequence from the given one using the following operations:   remove any self-closing tag \"<tagname/>\",  remove a pair of an opening and a closing tag that go consecutively (in this order) and have the same names. In other words, remove substring \"<tagname></tagname>\". For example, you may be given such document: \"<header><p><a/><b></b></p></header><footer></footer>\" but you may not be given documents \"<a>\", \"<a></b>\", \"</a><a>\" or \"<a><b></a></b>\".Obviously, for any opening tag there is the only matching closing one \\xe2\\x80\\x94 each such pair is called an element. A self-closing tag also is an element. Let\\'s consider that one element is nested inside another one, if tags of the first element are between tags of the second one. An element is not nested to itself. For instance, in the example above element \"b\" is nested in \"header\" and in \"p\", but it isn\\'t nested in \"a\" and \"footer\", also it isn\\'t nested to itself (\"b\"). Element \"header\" has three elements nested in it, and \"footer\" has zero.We need the BCSS rules to apply styles when displaying elements of the BHTML documents. Each rule is recorded as a subsequence of words \"x1 x2 ... xn\". This rule has effect over all such elements t, which satisfy both conditions from the list:  there is a sequence of nested elements with tagnames \"x1\", \"x2\", ..., \"xn\" (that is, the second element is nested in the first one, the third element is nested in the second one and so on),  this sequence ends with element t (i.e. tagname of element t equals \"xn\"). For example, element \"b\" meets the conditions of the rule \"a b\" if for element \"b\" exists element \"a\" in which it is nested. Element \"c\" meets the conditions of the rule \"a b b c\", if three elements exist: \"a\", \"b\", \"b\", and in the chain \"a\"-\"b\"-\"b\"-\"c\" each following element is nested in the previous one.Given a BHTML document and a set of BCSS rules, write a program that determines the number of elements that meet the conditions of each rule.',\n",

       " \"Vasya studies divisibility rules at school. Here are some of them: Divisibility by 2. A number is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit is divisible by 2 or in other words, is even. Divisibility by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Divisibility by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if and only if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. Divisibility by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit equals 5 or 0. Divisibility by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by 2 and 3 simultaneously (that is, if the last digit is even and the sum of all digits is divisible by 3). Divisibility by 7. Vasya doesn't know such divisibility rule. Divisibility by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if and only if its last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8. Divisibility by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Divisibility by 10. A number is divisible by 10 if and only if its last digit is a zero. Divisibility by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if and only if the sum of digits on its odd positions either equals to the sum of digits on the even positions, or they differ in a number that is divisible by 11.Vasya got interested by the fact that some divisibility rules resemble each other. In fact, to check a number's divisibility by 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10 it is enough to check fulfiling some condition for one or several last digits. Vasya calls such rules the 2-type rules.If checking divisibility means finding a sum of digits and checking whether the sum is divisible by the given number, then Vasya calls this rule the 3-type rule (because it works for numbers 3 and 9).If we need to find the difference between the sum of digits on odd and even positions and check whether the difference is divisible by the given divisor, this rule is called the 11-type rule (it works for number 11).In some cases we should divide the divisor into several factors and check whether rules of different types (2-type, 3-type or 11-type) work there. For example, for number 6 we check 2-type and 3-type rules, for number 66 we check all three types. Such mixed divisibility rules are called 6-type rules. And finally, there are some numbers for which no rule works: neither 2-type, nor 3-type, nor 11-type, nor 6-type. The least such number is number 7, so we'll say that in such cases the mysterious 7-type rule works, the one that Vasya hasn't discovered yet. Vasya's dream is finding divisibility rules for all possible numbers. He isn't going to stop on the decimal numbers only. As there are quite many numbers, ha can't do it all by himself. Vasya asked you to write a program that determines the divisibility rule type in the b-based notation for the given divisor d.\",\n",

You should help PMP finish his last contract.Each BRT line is straight line that passes n intersecting on its ways. At each intersection there is traffic light that periodically cycles between green and red. It starts illuminating green at time zero. During the green phase which lasts for g seconds, traffic is allowed to proceed. After the green phase the light changes to red and remains in this color for r seconds. During the red phase traffic is prohibited from proceeding. If a vehicle reaches the intersection exactly at a time when the light changes to red, it should stop, but the vehicle is clear to proceed if the light has just changed to green.  All traffic lights have the same timing and are synchronized. In other words the period of red (and green) phase is the same for all of traffic lights and they all start illuminating green at time zero.The BRT Company has calculated the time that a bus requires to pass each road segment. A road segment is the distance between two consecutive traffic lights or between a traffic light and source (or destination) station.

       " 'The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.In Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.The name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line.

No station is occurs in the loop line more than once.Note that a single station can be passed by any number of lines.According to Berland standards, there can't be more than one tunnel between two stations and each tunnel belongs to exactly one line. Naturally, each line has at least one tunnel. Between any two stations there is the way along the subway tunnels. In addition, in terms of graph theory, a subway is a vertex cactus: if we consider the subway as a graph in which the stations are the vertexes and the edges are tunnels, then each vertex lies on no more than one simple cycle.Unfortunately, scheme, stolen by the spy, had only the stations and the tunnels. It was impossible to determine to which line every tunnel corresponds. But to sabotage successfully, the spy needs to know what minimum and maximum number of lines may be in the Bertown subway.Help him!\",\n",

First, he cannot send the same group twice \\xe2\\x80\\x94 then soldiers get bored and they rebel. Second, not all soldiers are equally reliable. Every soldier has a reliability of ai. The reliability of the detachment is counted as the sum of reliabilities of soldiers in it.

       " 'The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.In Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.The name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings \"ab\" and \"ba\" is called \"abba\", and the dynasty, which had only the king \"abca\", is called \"abca\".Vasya, a historian, has recently found a list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives. Help Vasya to find the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed in Berland.Note that in his list all the names are ordered by the time, that is, if name A is earlier in the list than B, then if A and B were kings, then king A ruled before king B.',\n",

Now all squares are free. But the Bertown city administration never sleeps, and the approval of an application for the demonstration threatens to become a very complex process. The process of approval lasts several days, but every day the following procedure takes place:  The opposition shall apply to hold a demonstration at a free square (the one which isn't used by the administration).  The administration tries to move the demonstration to the worst free square left. To do this, the administration organizes some long-term activities on the square, which is specified in the application of opposition. In other words, the administration starts using the square and it is no longer free. Then the administration proposes to move the opposition demonstration to the worst free square. If the opposition has applied for the worst free square then request is accepted and administration doesn't spend money. If the administration does not have enough money to organize an event on the square in question, the opposition's application is accepted. If administration doesn't have enough money to organize activity, then rest of administration's money spends and application is accepted  If the application is not accepted, then the opposition can agree to the administration's proposal (that is, take the worst free square), or withdraw the current application and submit another one the next day. If there are no more days left before the meeting, the opposition has no choice but to agree to the proposal of City Hall. If application is accepted opposition can reject it. It means than opposition still can submit more applications later, but square remains free. In order to organize an event on the square i, the administration needs to spend ai bourles. Because of the crisis the administration has only b bourles to confront the opposition.

The room is divided into n rows, each row consists of m seats.There are k people lined up to the box office, each person wants to buy exactly one ticket for his own entertainment. Before the box office started selling tickets, each person found the seat that seemed best for him and remembered it as a pair of coordinates (xi,\\xe2\\x80\\x89yi), where xi is the row number, and yi is the seat number in this row.It is possible that some people have chosen the same place, then when some people see their favorite seat taken in the plan of empty seats in the theater, they choose and buy a ticket to another place. Each of them has the following logic: let's assume that he originally wanted to buy a ticket to seat (x1,\\xe2\\x80\\x89y1), then when he comes to the box office, he chooses such empty seat (x2,\\xe2\\x80\\x89y2), which satisfies the following conditions:   the value of |x1\\xe2\\x80\\x89-\\xe2\\x80\\x89x2|\\xe2\\x80\\x89+\\xe2\\x80\\x89|y1\\xe2\\x80\\x89-\\xe2\\x80\\x89y2| is minimum  if the choice is not unique, then among the seats that satisfy the first condition, this person selects the one for which the value of x2 is minimum  if the choice is still not unique, among the seats that satisfy the first and second conditions, this person selects the one for which the value of y2 is minimum Your task is to find the coordinates of a seat for each person.\",\n",

       " \"Any resemblance to any real championship and sport is accidental.The Berland National team takes part in the local Football championship which now has a group stage. Let's describe the formal rules of the local championship:   the team that kicked most balls in the enemy's goal area wins the game;  the victory gives 3 point to the team, the draw gives 1 point and the defeat gives 0 points;  a group consists of four teams, the teams are ranked by the results of six games: each team plays exactly once with each other team;  the teams that get places 1 and 2 in the group stage results, go to the next stage of the championship. In the group stage the team's place is defined by the total number of scored points: the more points, the higher the place is. If two or more teams have the same number of points, then the following criteria are used (the criteria are listed in the order of falling priority, starting from the most important one):   the difference between the total number of scored goals and the total number of missed goals in the championship: the team with a higher value gets a higher place;  the total number of scored goals in the championship: the team with a higher value gets a higher place;  the lexicographical order of the name of the teams' countries: the country with the lexicographically smaller name gets a higher place. The Berland team plays in the group where the results of 5 out of 6 games are already known. To be exact, there is the last game left. There the Berand national team plays with some other team. The coach asks you to find such score X:Y (where X is the number of goals Berland scored and Y is the number of goals the opponent scored in the game), that fulfills the following conditions:   X > Y, that is, Berland is going to win this game;  after the game Berland gets the 1st or the 2nd place in the group;  if there are multiple variants, you should choose such score X:Y, where value X\\xe2\\x80\\x89-\\xe2\\x80\\x89Y is minimum;  if it is still impossible to come up with one score, you should choose the score where value Y (the number of goals Berland misses) is minimum. \",\n",
       " \"Recently, Valery have come across an entirely new programming language. Most of all the language attracted him with template functions and procedures. Let us remind you that templates are tools of a language, designed to encode generic algorithms, without reference to some parameters (e.g., data types, buffer sizes, default values).Valery decided to examine template procedures in this language in more detail. The description of a template procedure consists of the procedure name and the list of its parameter types. The generic type T parameters can be used as parameters of template procedures.A procedure call consists of a procedure name and a list of variable parameters. Let's call a procedure suitable for this call if the following conditions are fulfilled:   its name equals to the name of the called procedure;  the number of its parameters equals to the number of parameters of the procedure call;  the types of variables in the procedure call match the corresponding types of its parameters. The variable type matches the type of a parameter if the parameter has a generic type T or the type of the variable and the parameter are the same. You are given a description of some set of template procedures. You are also given a list of variables used in the program, as well as direct procedure calls that use the described variables. For each call you need to count the number of procedures that are suitable for this call.\",\n",

That is why he has been invited to participate in a game show called \"Guess That Car!\".The game show takes place on a giant parking lot, which is 4n meters long from north to south and 4m meters wide from west to east. The lot has n\\xe2\\x80\\x89+\\xe2\\x80\\x891 dividing lines drawn from west to east and m\\xe2\\x80\\x89+\\xe2\\x80\\x891 dividing lines drawn from north to south, which divide the parking lot into n\\xc2\\xb7m 4 by 4 meter squares. There is a car parked strictly inside each square. The dividing lines are numbered from 0 to n from north to south and from 0 to m from west to east. Each square has coordinates (i,\\xe2\\x80\\x89j) so that the square in the north-west corner has coordinates (1,\\xe2\\x80\\x891) and the square in the south-east corner has coordinates (n,\\xe2\\x80\\x89m).

After that he can start guessing the cars. After Yura chooses a point, he will be prohibited to move along the parking lot before the end of the game show. As Yura is a car expert, he will always guess all cars he is offered, it\\'s just a matter of time. Yura knows that to guess each car he needs to spend time equal to the square of the euclidean distance between his point and the center of the square with this car, multiplied by some coefficient characterizing the machine\\'s \"rarity\" (the rarer the car is, the harder it is to guess it). More formally, guessing a car with \"rarity\" c placed in a square whose center is at distance d from Yura takes c\\xc2\\xb7d2 seconds. The time Yura spends on turning his head can be neglected.It just so happened that Yura knows the \"rarity\" of each car on the parking lot in advance. Help him choose his point so that the total time of guessing all cars is the smallest possible.',\n",

The bridges between the platforms are very fragile, and for each bridge the number of times one can pass this bridge from one of its ends to the other before it collapses forever is known in advance.The player's actions are as follows. First, he selects one of the platforms to be the starting position for his hero. After that the player can freely move the hero across the platforms moving by the undestroyed bridges. As soon as the hero finds himself on a platform with no undestroyed bridge attached to it, the level is automatically ended. The number of points scored by the player at the end of the level is calculated as the number of transitions made by the hero between the platforms. Note that if the hero started moving by a certain bridge, he has to continue moving in the same direction until he is on a platform.Find how many points you need to score to be sure that nobody will beat your record, and move to the next level with a quiet heart.\",\n",
